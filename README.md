# Ola-Ride-data-Analysis

# 🚖 Ola Ride Data Analysis using SQL and Power Bi

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes **Ola ride data** to uncover key insights about booking trends, ride cancellations, payment methods, and customer behavior. Using **SQL (MySQL Workbench)**, we performed data cleaning, aggregation, and trend analysis to provide business insights.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **SQL (MySQL Workbench)** – Data extraction, cleaning, and transformation  
- **Excel** – Data preprocessing and trend analysis  
- **Power BI (Optional)** – Visualization of ride trends and key metrics

## 📊 Key Insights & Analysis  
✅ Identified **successful bookings and revenue trends**  
✅ Analyzed **canceled rides by customers and drivers**  
✅ Found **top 5 customers with the highest bookings**  
✅ Computed **average ride distance per vehicle type**  
✅ Extracted **payment trends and incomplete ride reasons**

FROM bookings 
GROUP BY Customer_ID 
ORDER BY total_rides DESC LIMIT 5;
```

### **4️⃣ Total Booking Value of Successful Rides**  
```sql
CREATE VIEW Total_Successful_Ride_Value AS 
SELECT SUM(Booking_Value) AS total_revenue 
FROM bookings WHERE Booking_Status = 'Success';
